# Object-Oriented-Programming

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a style of programming characterized by the identification of classes of objects closely linked with the methods (functions) with which they are associated. It also includes ideas of inheritance of attributes and methods.

Here, we have implemented many OOP’s concepts in our Program which is “Event Management”.
Concepts such as Classes and Objects, Access specifiers, Method overloading and Method overriding, Constructors, Inheritance, Abstract class, Polymorphism, Exceptions and Interfaces have been applied here.
